# Parabellum Comply ISM
The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) authors the Information Security Manual (ISM), which defines a cyber security framework for organizations to protect against cyber threats using their risk management framework.

The ISM encompasses numerous controls for a system of systems. Traditionally, allocation is done through manual Excel spreadsheets, a process that's error-prone and slow, especially with quarterly ISM updates.

This application aims to mitigate these issues by utilizing a URL-based system with the ISM OSCAL definition. This allows for direct allocation of requirements to specific components, integrating control definitions into the system to establish a foundational reference for allocation.
